Name: _RunVSCode
Trigger: None
Action: Start Program: "C:\Users\zhurai\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
Notes: This enables me to use a .bat script to run this program as a non elevated user, as I needed elevated user for my emulators (so parts of my login script are elevated), but VSCode does not like to be elevated
