Name: _RunVSCode
Trigger: None
Action: Start Program: "C:\Users\zhurai\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\GitHubDesktop.exe"
Notes: This enables me to use a .bat script to run this program as a non elevated user, as I needed elevated user for my emulators (so parts of my login script are elevated), but VSCode does not like to be elevated. Unsure if this means GitHubDesktop should not either, but just in case.
