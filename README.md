This is just a personal collection of scripts that I use to automate my computer to start up, put into git form so I can track changes and how my scripts have changed 

I use [WindowManager](https://www.desksoft.com/WindowManager.htm) to force my windows into specific locations
But I also use these scripts when I start up, shut down, periodically to restart the emulators (mostly LDPlayer), and other tasks

Some of which changes over time as my setup changes, but I also enjoy automating what I can (which is just starting/restarting the emulators) and directing them to start an app (usually does not go further than this except specific games that don't care about automation like AE)

(Note, while I am starting this repository in April 2022, I've been editing and remaking my setup periodically for months)
